# Personal Assistent

The idea of this project is simples: Make a Jarvis from Iron Man.

Yeah, the idea is pretty simple, but I bet it's reeeeaaally hard to do it.

With a step at a time, we get there. I'll try to develop a checklist to know what I need to do and where I am right now. The cheklist and this hole README file will be very broad at the start, so it will be always updated as the project grow and I learn more about what I need to do.

Anyway, Let's star simple and get it growing. One day we'll eventually get there.

# Checklist

- [ ] Make and AI that knows a lot of words in English, maybe just the most used, but if possible, all.
- [ ] Make the AI understand what each word that it knows means.
- [ ] Make the AI understand sentences.
- [ ] Make the AI be able to respond the sentences when needed.
- [ ] Make the AI be connected to the web, so it can answers questions more precisely.
